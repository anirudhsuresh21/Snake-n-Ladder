# Snake-n-Ladder
This is Snake and Ladder game which will directly run on the Command Prompt or any of the Python IDLE's.
This project has been made according to the need of my college project.

Data Structure is an important Topic in Computer Science.
I have used the concept of Array or Lists(as called in Python) to develop this project.

Lists has been used to define the starting and ending points of the Ladder and Snake.
